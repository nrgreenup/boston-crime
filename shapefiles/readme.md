## Boston Crime Shapefiles

Description: These are the files necessary for manipulating data and creating maps using ArcGIS (particularly, ArcMap). To use them, download all files into a single folder and establish a [folder connection](http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/map/working-with-arcmap/using-folder-connections.htm) to that folder in ArcMap. Shapefiles can be imported into ArcMap using the "add data" toolbar function. 

## File Descriptions

      tl_2017_25_trct: raw relevant mapping files of Boston census tracts without additional joined data
