# Boston Crime 

Description: This project contains analyses of Boston crime rates R and the ArcGIS suite (namely, ArcMap). These analyses were a part of a semester term project completed for a graduate-level geographic information systems course. R is used for cleaning crime data, producing 2- and 3-dimensional scatterplots, and fitting simple and multiple linear regression models. ArcMap is used for joining crime and demographic data with shapefiles - which contain spatial information about census tracts in Boston - and creating choropleth maps of crime rates, median income, and racial composition at the census tract level.
